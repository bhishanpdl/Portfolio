# Analysis Salaries of Ohio University Professors

In this project my goal was to find and compare the salaries of professors of Ohio University according to Colleges and departments. I got the salary data from the [HR website](https://www.ohio.edu/instres/faculty/AAUP1718.pdf) for the year of 
2018 and did some data wrangling and vizualization.

We can view the rendered version of notebook using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bhishanpdl/Portfolio/blob/master/Analysis_of_OU_Profs_Salaries/ou_prof_salaries_by_dept.ipynb).


The data format was pdf and the preview of first page is given below:
