# kaggle project of Airnb Data Analysis

In this project I took the data from [Kaggle Airnb New User Bookings Project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data). I studied the age distribution of Airnb users. The age was taken between 10 years and 100 years after cleaning the data. Also, the gender-wise registration was studied and plots are created.
